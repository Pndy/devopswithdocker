as the environment vars were declared in the Dockerfiles,
i wasnt able to override then and set the REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL var
from docker-compose.yml

so i removed the env vars from both dockerfiles, built new images
and had the env var in docker-compose, pointing to the right place


i also finished this exercise at 2.9 as i made the necessary changes
while fixing that, but had typo on "hellofrontend:2.8" imagename,
so i have fixed and cleaned up them a little.


All buttons work after the changes
